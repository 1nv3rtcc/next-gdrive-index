export const getting_started = `Welcome to the deployment guide! This guide will help you to deploy the application to Vercel or similar services.

If you are new to this project, you can follow along from the beginning.
But if you've already deployed the app before and want to upgrade from v1, you can skip to the [Migrating from v1](#migrating) section.  
You can also use this guide to [configure the app](#config) and [customize the theme](#theme).  

**We recommend you to use this deployment guide on a desktop browser for optimal experience.**

_**Note:** This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of how to deploy a Next.js app on Vercel or other platforms._`;

export const new_user_guide = `Prerequisites:
- A basic understanding of Vercel (or similar services)
- Google Cloud Platform account

### Fork or Clone the repository
It's pretty obvious, but you need to fork the repository to your account.
You can [click here](https://github.com/mbahArip/next-gdrive-index/fork) to fork the repository.  
You can choose any repository name, description, and visibility.

But if you want to run it locally, you can clone the repository instead.

### Create a Google Cloud Platform project and enable Google Drive API
We need an access to Google Drive API to get the files from Google Drive.
So you need to create a project in Google Cloud Platform and enable Google Drive API to get your own credentials.

1. Go to [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Click the \`New Project\` button
3. Enter a project name, and click the \`Create\` button
4. After the project is created, click the \`Enable APIs and Services\` button
5. Search for Google Drive API, and click the \`Enable\` button

### Create a Service Account and get the credentials
After enabling the Google Drive API, we need to create a service account to get the credentials.
The credentials will be used to authenticate the application to access the Google Drive API and get the files.

1. On [APIs & Services](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard) page, click the \`Credentials\` menu on the sidebar
2. Click the \`Create Credentials\` button, and choose \`Service account\`
3. Enter your service account name and description, and then click the \`Done\` button
4. You will see the service account you just created on \`Service Account\` table, click the name of the service account to open the details
5. Go to \`Keys\` tab, then click the \`Add Key\` button and choose the \`Create new key\`
6. Pick \`JSON\` as the key type and click the \`Create\` button
7. The JSON file will be downloaded to your computer, and **keep it safe**. We will use it later on the configuration

_**Note:** The JSON file contains sensitive information, don't share it with anyone_

### Create shared folder in Google Drive
Since the service account can't access your Root folder, you need to create a new folder, and share it with the service account.
This folder will be used as the root folder for the application.

> If you're using or the folder you want to share inside Shared Drive, you can skip this step and go to the [Shared Drive Guide](#shared-drive)

1. Go to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/)
2. Click the \`New\` button, and choose \`Folder\` to create a new folder, you can name it anything you want
3. Right-click the folder you just created, and choose \`Share\`
4. Enter the email address of the service account you just created (you can find it on the JSON file, or on the service account details page)
5. To allow download files larger than deployment limit, you need to enable \`Link sharing\` and set it to \`Anyone with the link\`
6. Copy the folder ID from the URL, it's the part after \`/folders/\` in the URL (e.g: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/ \`<folder_id>\` )

### Configuring the app and Customizing the theme
Now we need to configure the app to use the credentials and folder ID we just created.
You can follow the [App Configuration](#config) and [Customize Theme](#theme) sections to configure the app and customize the theme.

_**Note:** You can skip the theme customization, but you **NEED** to configure the app_

### Deploy the app
On this guide we will use Vercel to deploy the app, but you can use other platforms like Netlify, Heroku, etc.
But don't forget to adjust the \`fileSizeLimit\` on the [configuration](#config) if you use other platforms.

> Before deploying, make sure you have pushed the changes to your repository


1. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
2. Click on the \`Add new\` button, and choose \`Project\`
3. Choose the repository you just forked
4. On the \`Environment Variables\` section, copy the whole content from \`.env.local\` you just downloaded from [configuration](#config) section, and paste it on the key fields. It will automatically add all the environment variables needed
5. Click the \`Deploy\` button
6. Wait for the deployment to finish, and open project
7. Go to \`Settings\` tab, and click the \`Functions\` menu, and select your \`Function Region\` to the nearest region to your location for optimal speed
8. Go to \`Deployment\` tab, click the 3 dots on the right side of the latest \`Production\` deployment, and click the \`Redeploy\` button to apply the changes

For other platforms, you can check their own documentation for Next.js deployment guide.

### Done! üéâ
Congratulations! You have successfully deployed the app.`;

export const shared_drive_guide = `I'm separating this guide in case someone who already using v1 can see this guide easily.

As of version 2.0.2 we added support for Shared Drive, and the demo actually using a Shared Drive.
You can follow this guide to use Shared Drive as the root folder for the application.

1. Go to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/)
2. Open the \`Shared Drives\` menu from the sidebar
3. Right click on the Shared Drive you want to use, and choose \`Manage members\`
4. Add your service account email address to the members list, and give it at least \`Viewer\` permission
5. Open the \`Shared Drive\`, and copy the ID from the URL, it's the part after \`/drive/u/0/folders/\` in the URL (e.g: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/ \`<drive_id>\` )
6. Paste the ID to \`Shared Drive\` field on the [configuration](#config) section, and set the \`is Team Drive\` to \`true\`
7. For the root folder, you can set it to the folder ID inside the Shared Drive, or use the Shared Drive ID as the root folder ID
8. Update the configuration file, and redeploy the app to apply the changes
9. Done! üéâ

If you don't want to use the configuration section below, you can encrypt your \`Shared Drive\` ID using the \`/api/internal/encrypt?q=<drive_id>\` endpoint, and update the config file directly.
`;

export const migration_guide = `If you've already deployed the app before and want to upgrade from v1, you can follow this guide to migrate the app to the latest version.

### Update your environment and configuration
If you still have the \`.env.local file\`, you can go to the [configuration](#config) section, and load the file to update the environment variables.
If you don't have it, go to your deployment platform and copy the environment variables from the platform to the [configuration](#config) section.

You can also load the old \`gindex.config.ts\` file to the [configuration](#config) section to set the default configuration.

### Update the repository
First, you need to update the repository to the latest version.
If you open your forked repository, you will see a notification that the repository is behind the original repository.
You can sync the repository by clicking the \`Sync fork\` button.
After the repository is updated, you can replace the \`gindex.config.ts\` file with the new one.

### Update deployment
Now go to your Vercel project page (or other platforms).
Go to the \`Settings\` tab, and click the \`Environment Variables\` menu.
You can delete all the old environment variables, and copy the new environment variables from the updated \`.env.local\` file.
Now you can redeploy the app to apply the changes.
